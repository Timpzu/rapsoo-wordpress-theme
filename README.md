# Räpsöö Portfolio WordPress Theme

I built the Räpsöö Portfolio WordPress Theme based on [my website (lehtosentimo.fi)](https://lehtosentimo.fi). I have tried to pay special attention to accessibility and usability from a technical and visual standpoint. I wrote the code so that the site is clear to navigate with different assistive technology. The visual layout has high contrast colours, and the font is easily legible.

With all my WordPress development projects, I aim to make the themes accessible to administrators and editors. Content is easy to add, and every component is effortlessly customisable. They usually require only the essential use of third-party plugins.

The Räpsöö Portfolio WordPress Theme is free to use and download. A word of warning, it is still a work in progress. Some problems exist in mobile usability, for example. Instructions for installing and using the theme are published later on GitHub.
